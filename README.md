**TASK**: You will perform your own Spotify Wrapped analysis using the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries using the personal listening history CSV that has been provided with this assignment. From the data that is stored in this CSV, youâ€™ll generate statistical insights and data visualizations using the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries.

## Assignment Requirements

A completed `streaming_analysis.py` file should contain:
- A DataFrame with at least 4 columns and 10 items/entries. The DataFrame should contain data stored in [`streaming_data.csv`](streaming_data.csv) that is read using the [`.read_csv()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_csv.asp) method.
- A descriptive statistical analysis on your DataFrame using Pandas. This analysis should include:
    - Average of `completion_rate` column
    - Calculated total time the listener spent listening to music
    - A Dataframe of the top 5 most listened to artists. 
    - A Datagrame of the top 10 most listened to songs.
    - A DataFrame of the top 5 most streamed genres.
    - Calculated value for the amount of songs listened to by day.
    - Calculated value for the amount of songs listened to by month.
- Code to generate a histogram using Matplotlib.
